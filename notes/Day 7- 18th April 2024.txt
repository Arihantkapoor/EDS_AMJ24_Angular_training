Day 7- 18th April 2024



one way binding 

view to component binding

  event binding    


component to view binding

    interpolation, property binding and Attribute binding



two way binding -- [(ngModel)] ----  FormsModule ----we have import this module and register with appModule.


if i change something in component it should reflect to view and vice versa.


Angular event -- ngModelChange ----ngModel - on every single char change it fires

vs 

DOM event--  Change  - it fires on lost focus.




Directives--
	It give the instructions/directions in DOM to enhance the capabilities of HTML elements
 
	It will change the structure of the HTML elements by structural directives like *ngIf, *ngFor loop, *ngSwitch conditions
 
	We have if conditions loops, switch statements for our coding like ts/c# but what if I want to applyt these on HTML elements
 
	so here Angular come up with structural directives.
 
	Component is also a directive and it gives the directions to any component class by attributes like selector: templateUrl: and styleUrl: etc.
 
	We can create our own custom directives and can use it with any HTML tag attribute.
 
	When I create the custom directives @directive decorator is used
 
	command to create our own directive is -- ng g directive my-directive


Ng Template is Angular tag which by default don't render to HTML DOM by this we can hide HTML elements
 
Ng Template works with conditional approach by using template reference variable

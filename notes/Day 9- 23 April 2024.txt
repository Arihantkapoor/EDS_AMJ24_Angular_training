Pipes in Angular
 
     There are two categories of pipes in angular
> first is build in pipes 
> second is custom pipes 
     we can create parameterized pipes and chaining of pipes
     some of inbuild pipes are
 
          1.Json pipes
          2.key value pipes
          3.Async pipes(this we will use with services)
          4.date pipes
          5.slice pipes
          6.Currency pipes
          7.Numbers/decimal pipes
          8.Percent pipes
          9.Lowercase and Uppercase pipes
 
       Async and await are markers which mark code position from where control should resume after a task or thread completes.
 


Default Sorting in KeyValue Pipe : 
1. Default sorting is in Ascending order if keys are number.
2. Default sorting is in Alphabetical order if keys are string.
3. If keys are of different types, then you convert keys to string values and then it will be in alphabetical order.

Internal functionality of  *ngIf:
 
	1> Here we have TemplateRef  this will tell to angular which block to view
 
	2> ViewContainerRef is a class to give the reference of which view container needs to display
 

TemplateRef - represents the element where directive is applied. and ViewContainer has the container element for the component. and createEmbed method embed the eligible view into DOM

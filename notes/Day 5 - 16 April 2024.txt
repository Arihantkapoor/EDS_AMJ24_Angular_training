Building blocks of Angular application-

Building Blocks of Angular Application
 
-> from Angular 2 to 16, we are constructing blocks of our angular application by AppModule/ngModule
 
1) we add modules(form, app modules)
 
2) we add components
 
3) use templates
 
4) data binding
 
5) to enhance the existing tags, we use inbuilt directives(*ngFor, *ngIf, *ngSwitch etc);
 
6) we can create our custom directives also for my own tags
 
7) creation of own tags by components and append to existing HTML, this is set to be virtual DOM
 
8) we create services in angular to hit RESTful core web api, web api 2.0 etc
 
9) we use the concept of IOC(inversion of control) and DI(Dependency Injection) to call my service
 
10) in angular we have IOC container(Ninject or Ninja) to create my memory allocation etc

1.trackby we use in ngfor
2.It improves the performance when we have bulk of records
3.It tracks the already displayed records and only 
upload new record everytime
4.ngfor uploads or displayed all the records everytime 
so not good for performance



1.We have done with structural directives ngFor,ngSwitch,ngIf .So these directives are updating my DOM elements dynamically.
 
2.Now we have to discuss attribute directive : ngStyle and ngClass
 
3.If we want to bind style dynamically to an HTML element then we can use ngStyle.For static binding we have style attribute with us.
 
4.By the help of ngStyle attribute directive we can apply multiple styles dynamically.
 
5.So we can bind CSS classes dynamically by the help of ngClass attribute directive.
 
6.ngClass attribute can bind multiple CSS classes.


Pipes in Angular:
 
	1. pipe is a very important feature of angular to modify your data format or display data 
	2. We have some inbuilt pipes as below:
		--->DatePipe (change the format of the date)
		--->CurrencyPipe(Provides currency symbol etc)
		--->UpperCase(Converts the content to uppercase)
		--->LowerCase(Converts the content to lowercase)
 
		---> NumberPipes/DecimalPipes (It helps to decide you fraction of decimal and numbers format)
		---> PercentPipe (It gives the percentafe of your data and '%' symbol)
		VVI --> KeyValuePipe(It converts your objects to key and value parameters and it works on sorting also)
		--->async Pipe (we use this in the case of services and when we are getting data from promise or observable)
